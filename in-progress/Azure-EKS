# Azure EKS (Azure Kubernetes Service)

## 1. Technology Overview:
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a managed Kubernetes service provided by Microsoft Azure. It simplifies the deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications using Kubernetes.

## 2. Key Concepts:
- **Node Pools:** Azure EKS allows the creation of multiple node pools with different machine types, enabling optimization for specific workloads.
- **Azure Monitor Integration:** Integration with Azure Monitor for detailed monitoring and diagnostics of your Kubernetes clusters.

## 3. Architecture:
- **Control Plane:** Azure EKS includes a managed Kubernetes control plane for simplified cluster management.
- **Node Agents:** Worker nodes run as agents in the cluster, hosting the containerized applications.

## 4. Use Cases:
- **Scalable Container Orchestration:** Azure EKS is ideal for orchestrating and scaling containerized applications, providing a robust and efficient solution for managing container workloads.
- **Microservices Architecture:** Supports the deployment of microservices-based applications, allowing teams to independently develop, deploy, and scale components.

## 5. Clients and Industries:
- **Clients:** Organizations such as [Client A], [Client B], and [Client C] have successfully implemented Azure EKS for their containerized workloads.
- **Industries:** Widely used in industries like finance, e-commerce, and healthcare for deploying and managing scalable and resilient applications.

## 6. Integration:
- **Azure DevOps Integration:** Seamless integration with Azure DevOps for continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.
- **Azure Container Registry:** Easily integrates with Azure Container Registry for secure storage and management of container images.
